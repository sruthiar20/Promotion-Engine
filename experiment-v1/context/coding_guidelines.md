# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions
- Dont use comments

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions
